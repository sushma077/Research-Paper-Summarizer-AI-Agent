Minor Issue:- In the Jupyter Notebook and Python source code, I’m encountering a minor issue — even when I request summaries for 3 papers, the API returns 5 research papers. However, the content is accurate, and it provides relevant papers with correct summaries. The only issue is with the number of papers being returned.

In the Streamlit code, which is designed for user interaction, the output is correct, and it returns the exact number of papers requested.
